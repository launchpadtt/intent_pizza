Test Plan

The testcases are written using Cucumber (with Capybara)

Each test suite corresponds to a feature and each testcase corresponds to a scenario

Only one testcase is passing where it should be failing which is the testcase "Remove an unordered pizza".
This is due to a regex issue that I could not diagnose in time for the 5 day deadline.   

Some of the cases that are failing are due to constraints that I think the application should have which it
doesn't actually have. These include the size limit on the password, the uniqueness of the pizza order names,
the uniqueness on the topping names etc. I was not supplied with documentation on what those limitations should
actually be, so assumptions were made based on reasonable expectations.

There are cases where the expected results were not checked that would have otherwise been checked since it is
debatable whether they can be considered user facing side effects. These are primarily instances with forms
that should stay on their original URL when they return form errors. Instead the URL changes to the URL of the
resultant page even though it didn't actually successful complete the form. This does result in the bugs with the
login however.

The major bugs in the app that were found are below. With the exception mentioned above, the testcases uncover
these bugs:

* The Create a New user link just takes you to the account page when you've already logged in, instead of taking
  you to the page to Create a New User
* If you're already logged in the login page takes you to the account of the previous login even though you log
  in with a different user
* The Remove link for a pizza doesn't remove the pizza. It takes you to the details page of the pizza
* The Remove link for a topping doesn't have a view. It just takes you to a Ruby on Rails error page.

The only other check that was not completeable in the 5-day deadline was simulating restarting the capybara session
in order to run another login. This is needed for the edit account testcases.
