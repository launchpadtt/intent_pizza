In order to install the Intent Pizza application:

1. Make sure that you have Ruby installed
2. Run 'gem install bundler'
3. From the root of the application directory run 'bundle install'
4. Run 'rake db:migrate' to set up the database
5. Run 'rails s' to start the server 
   (you'll be able to view the app at http://localhost:3000)
6. Run 'bundle exec cucumber' to run your cucumber tests (after writing them)

The goal is to use Cucumber to test the functional flow through the
application. In particular, we want to test the options around creating a 
user, logging in, and ordering some pizzas with various toppings. The app 
itself should be fairly self explanatory. Feel free to email us
(qa@intentmedia.com) with any questions about it.
